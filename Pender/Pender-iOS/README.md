# Pender

2D Hardware accelerated Canvas context for mobile
this is the iOS version

##Embedded Javascript Engine

Pender uses an embedded Javascript engine. This allows for fast dynamic parsing of javascript targeting the Pender Canvas. 

On iOS, pender uses SpiderMonkey. Specifically, we compiled the excellent iMonkey project, available here [https://github.com/couchbaselabs/iMonkey](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/iMonkey).

A static library will be provided along with the project.
Or you can compile the entire project (instructions pending)
